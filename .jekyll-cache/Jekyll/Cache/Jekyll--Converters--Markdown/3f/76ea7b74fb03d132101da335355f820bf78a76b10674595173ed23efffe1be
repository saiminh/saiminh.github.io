				<h3>Custom WordPress website</h3>
				<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>racey herself beautifully photopgraphs her delicious dishes, which makes up a big part of the site's aesthetic identity. So the design of typography and other elements is deliberately simple and lightweight.</p>  
				<p>The site allows for specific recipe content types and has a well planned taxonomy so finding the right content is a breeze for users, whether through search or by browsing.</p> 
				<h3>"Cookmode on"</h3>
				<p>We share a hatred for the way recipe sites often hide the important info under a myriad of bla. So we invented 'Cookmode', a button at the top of every recipe page that hides everything but the ingredients and the process.</p>
