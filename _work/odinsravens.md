			<h2>Trying to change an old story</h2>
			<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>hen you live in the Netherlands, you can't escape the annual heated discussion around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet">'Zwarte Piet'</a>. I tried approach the issue from a different angle.</p>
			<p>After researching the roots of the tradition and of the story behind it, I found that this story is older than most people know and has probably been subject to massive changes over centuries.</p>
			<p>So I created a microsite with bespoke illustrations and animation and I try to raise the question: Could the story be changed again to fit into today's time?<br />
