			<p><span class="drop_cap">F</span>ull disclosure: <a href="https://cookingwithnothing.com">cookingwithnothing.com</a> is the outlet of my girlfriend Tracey Ingram, who is a gifted writer and editor. She <em>"grew up with a tonne of tummy problems"</em> and has ever since been writing about her experiences, treatments and recipes to help others with similar problems.</p>
			<h4>"Cookmode on"</h4>
			<p>I developed a custom WordPress site that is built around her unique content. We share a hatred for the way recipe sites often hide the important info under a myriad of bla. So we invented 'Cookmode', a button at the top of every recipe page that hides everything but the ingredients and the process.</p>
			<p><a class="button" href="https://cookingwithnothing.com" target="_blank">Try cooking with nothing</a></p>

				<h4>Cooking with nothing, looking like something</h4>
				<p><span class="drop_cap">S</span>ince this site is so unique and specific, it needed a distinct identity. Together we agreed on a color palette and logo concept. The wordmark conveys the idea of dietary restrictions with negative space in the word 'no'.</p>
				<p>Tracey herself beautifully photopgraphs her delicious dishes, which makes up a big part of the site's aesthetic identity. So the design of typography and other elements is deliberately simple and lightweight.</p>
