            <h3>Sustainable multi-use capes</h3>
			<p><span class="drop_cap">J</span>ulahas is an exciting new fashion brand that produces natural, seasonless, free-size Capes.</p>
            <p>These are co-created by a team of young, global designers and rural artisans and then handcrafted with 100% natural and responsibly sourced wool, made in small batches. The capes can be worn in many different ways (at least 15).</p>
            <p>I helped to bring the brands' values to life visually and to create a website and shop that translates these into sales.</p>

			<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he logo is a simple wordmark. All letters are made up of only two different shapes, a straight line and a curve. This represents the simplicity and versatility of the capes. The two lines coming together to form the 's' at the end of the wordmark represent the weaving process.</p>

                <h2>Shopify website</h2>
                <p>The website is running on Shopify with a custom made theme. It was important for the client to be able to tell the story about the process and philosophy of the brand, so custom templates had to be created to realize the original vision with the Shopify CMS.</p>
